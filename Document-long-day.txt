#What is long day?
Long day game start from project of my algorithm teacher and my dream job are game developer.
#File breakdown
let's start with "image" folder, In folder contain file .png file and all this file is background image and tile image.
The "sound" folder have a button sound-effect, scoring sound-effect(coin), pop sound-effect and background music.
"audio" c program is write all function like "init_audio" is for initialize audio
engine,"init_sfx" is like "init_audio" but difference from "init_audio" because "init_sfx" 
need to initialize it and make it usable for one time and then stop the audio also pre-load
it for it able to execute every time unlike "init_audio" need to load from start of game on 
loop until stop the game."play_bgm" is a play begin play some background music for the game 
from load music in "init_audio" find an audio file also "play_sfx" is the same thing as 
"play-bgm".For the "audio.h" this file is for call on other C program files such as 
"main.c" also a library file for made this game are "miniaudio.c", "miniaudio.h", "tigr.c", 
"tigr.h" and for a data file that's stored game score "file.txt".
